# Network Traffic Limiter

Limit network device activity based on specific rules on a home network, currently using **Asus-Merlin** compatible device.

The program will basically monitor the internet traffic and the device status, and disable that device if the amount of time spent that day/week exceed a specified limit.

The main idea is to send the current device usage to a remote device capable to display that data (an Android App or a simple device based on Arduino/RPI with an LCD/Led display).

All of this for educating us creating "good habit" on network device usage, increasing our awareness on how much time we spend daily on some activity, like playing with the PS4, sacrificing another one, like going out for a walk.

## Gather information

The router should have the _Asus-Merlin_ firmware installed, and the _ssh_ access enabled.

### Get list of devices

We can get the list of currently connected devices issuing one of the following command:

```
admin@RT-AC68U:/# bwdpi device
...
admin@RT-AC68U:/# cat /tmp/clientlist.json
...
```

### Get Web Traffic

We can update web traffic information issuing the command:

```
admin@RT-AC68U:/# WebHistory -e
```

We can access web traffic information accessing the sqlite db located here:

```
admin@RT-AC68U:/# sqlite3 /jffs/.sys/TrafficAnalyzer/TrafficAnalyzer.db
SQLite version 3.7.2
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> .table
history
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE history(mac TEXT NOT NULL,timestamp UNSIGNED BIG INT NOT NULL,url TEXT NOT NULL);
CREATE INDEX mac ON history(mac ASC);
CREATE INDEX timestamp ON history(timestamp ASC);
CREATE INDEX url ON history(url ASC);
```

### Get Traffic Analisys

We can update traffic analisys information issuing the command:

```
admin@RT-AC68U:/# TrafficAnalyzer -e
```

We can access web traffic information accessing the sqlite db located here:

```
admin@RT-AC68U:/# sqlite3 /jffs/.sys/TrafficAnalyzer/TrafficAnalyzer.db
SQLite version 3.7.2
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite> .table
traffic
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE traffic(mac TEXT NOT NULL, app_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, cat_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, timestamp UNSIGNED BIG INT NOT NULL, tx UNSIGNED BIG INT NOT NULL, rx UNSIGNED BIG INT NOT NULL);
CREATE INDEX app_name ON traffic(app_name ASC);
CREATE INDEX cat_name ON traffic(cat_name ASC);
CREATE INDEX mac ON traffic(mac ASC);
CREATE INDEX timestamp ON traffic(timestamp ASC);
```

## Limit device access

### Using control script

It is possible to remotly control the PS4 powerup and powerdown using a script called [PS4-waker](https://github.com/dhleong/ps4-waker), developed decoding the protocol used by the PS4 remote screen utility.

The command works as follow:

```
C:\>ps4-waker --help
ps4-waker - Wake your PS4 (and more!) with help from the Playstation App

Usage:
  ps4-waker [options]                       Wake PS4 device(s)
  ps4-waker [options] check                 Check a device's status
  ps4-waker [options] osk-submit [text]     Submit the OSK, optionally
                                            providing the text
  ps4-waker [options] remote <key-name...>  Send remote key-press event(s)
  ps4-waker [options] search                Search for devices
  ps4-waker [options] standby               Request the device enter
                                            standby/rest mode
  ps4-waker [options] start <titleId>       Start a specified title id
  ps4-waker --help | -h | -?                Shows this help message.
  ps4-waker --version | -v                  Show package version.

Options:
  --bind | -b <ip>             Bind to a specific network adapter IP, if
                               you have multiple
  --bind-port | -p <port>      Bind on a specific port, if you need to
                               route specifically
  --credentials | -c <file>    Specify credentials file
  --device | -d <ip>           Specify IP address of a specific PS4
  --failfast                   Don't request credentials if none
  --skip-login                 Don't automatically login
  --pin <pin-code>             Manual pin-code registration
  --pass <passcode>            Provide passcode for login, if needed
  --timeout | -t <time>        Stop searching after <time> milliseconds;
                               the default timeout, if unspecified, is 10
                               seconds

Device selection:
  For any command, there are four possible conditions based on the flags
  you've specified:
    1. Neither -t nor -d: Will act on the first device found; this is for
       households with a single device on the network
    2. Just -t: Will act on every device found within <time> millseconds
    3. Just -d: Will search for at most 10 seconds (the default timeout)
       for and only act on the provided device, quitting if found
    4. Both -t and -d: Will search for at most <time> seconds for and only
       act on the provided device, qutting early if found.

Checking device status:
  The "check" command provides output similar to "search," but only for
  the first matching device found (see above). In addition, it will exit
  with code '0' only if the device is awake; if it is in standby, it
  will exit with code '1', and in any other situation it will exit with
  code '2'. This command is intended to simplify initial state detection
  for home automation users.

Key names:
  Button names are case insensitive, and can be one of:
    up, down, left, right, enter, back, option, ps
  You cannot send the actual x, square, etc. buttons.
  A string of key presses may be provided, separated by spaces, and they
   will be sent sequentially.
  In addition, a key name may be followed by a colon and a duration in
   milliseconds to hold that key, eg: ps4-waker remote ps:1000
```

### Using firewall rules

We can limit network access to a device updating the two mac address list:

- wl0_maclist_x for 2.4Ghz
- wl1_maclist_x for 5.0Ghz

The [user script](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/User-scripts) section of the online documentation describe the procedure for inserting a new script into the system.

The following commands will update the mac address black list and block that device:

```
maclist="<mac1>client1<mac2>client2"
nvram set wl0_maclist_x=$maclist
nvram set wl1_maclist_x=$maclist
nvram commit
service restart_wireless
```

## Present data

The device is accessible trough https, and all the file related to the web site are saved into the squashfs file of the firmware, so they cannot modified. But I discovered that there are some symbolic links to an external directory, easy writable:

```
admin@RT-AC68U-2530:/www# ls -la
...
-rw-rw-r--    1 admin    root            46 Aug 14 22:22 ureip.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            15 Aug 14 22:23 user -> /tmp/var/wwwext
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user1.asp -> user/user1.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            15 Aug 14 22:22 user10.asp -> user/user10.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user2.asp -> user/user2.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user3.asp -> user/user3.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user4.asp -> user/user4.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user5.asp -> user/user5.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user6.asp -> user/user6.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user7.asp -> user/user7.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user8.asp -> user/user8.asp
lrwxrwxrwx    1 admin    root            14 Aug 14 22:22 user9.asp -> user/user9.asp
drwxrwxr-x    2 admin    root             3 Aug 14 22:22 userRpm
-rw-rw-r--    1 admin    root          4446 Aug 14 22:22 usp_style.css
...
```

Ideally, creating a script named `/tmp/var/wwwext/user1.asp` will allow to present data in a fancy way accessible to the url `https://router.asus.com:8443/user1.asp`, thanks also to the included chart.js library.

## Cross compiling

We need to cross-compile an application for the MIPS architecture, and we need to setup the environment as described in [this guide](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng/wiki/Compile-Firmware-from-source-using-Ubuntu).

The following example can be used as a starting point:

```
CC = mipsel-uclibc-gcc
CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall -pipe -mtune=mips32r2 -mips32r2 -isystem /home/youruser/asuswrt-merlin/release/src-rt/linux/linux-2.6/include -I./include
OFILES = main.o otherfile.o

TARGET = yourprogram

all:    $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OFILES)
        $(CC) $(OFILES) -o $(TARGET)
        chmod 4711 $(TARGET)

main.o: Makefile main.c include/main.h include/otherfile.h
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

otherfile.o: Makefile comm.c include/main.h include/otherfile.h
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c comm.c

clean:
        rm -f $(TARGET) *.o
```
